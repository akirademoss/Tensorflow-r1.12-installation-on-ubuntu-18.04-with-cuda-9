# Install Tensorflow r1.12 on Ubuntu 18.04 with cuda 9
This file contains step by step instructions to build Tensorflow r1.12 from sources with cuda v9.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.  A prerequisite is to have cuda v9.0 installed.  Instructions on doing this can be found [here](https://github.com/akirademoss/cuda-9.0-installation-on-ubuntu-18.04). 

## Summary of Steps 
```
1.) Install Bazel 0.15.2
2.) Instal NCCL 2.1.15
3.) Install Python 3.6
4.) Build and install Tensorflow r1.12 from source

```

## 1.) Install Bazel 0.15.2

#### Bazel needs a C++ compiler and unzip / zip in order to work:
```
sudo apt-get install g++ unzip zip
```

#### 1.1)  If you want to build Java code using Bazel, install a JDK:
```
# Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) uses OpenJDK 11 by default:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
```

#### 1.2)  download the installer by [bazel-0.15.2-installer-linux-x86_64.sh](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.15.2/bazel-0.15.2-installer-linux-x86_64.sh) installer.
```
cd ~/Downloads/
chmod +x bazel-0.15.2-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
./bazel-0.15.2-installer-linux-x86_64.sh --user
```
The ```--user``` flag installs Bazel to the ```$HOME/bin``` directory on your system and sets the ```.bazelrc``` path to ```$HOME/.bazelrc```. Use the --help command to see additional installation options.

#### 1.3)  If you ran the Bazel installer with the --user flag as above, the Bazel executable is installed in your $HOME/bin directory. Itâ€™s a good idea to add this directory to your default paths, as follows: note that you will need to swap 'your-username-here' with your username.  
You need to run '''source ~/.bashrc''' anytime you use update the file for it to take effect in your terminal.  Verify the install by noting the output of bazel version
```
echo 'export PATH=/home/your-username-here/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
bazel version
```

## 2.) Install NCCL 2.1.15

#### 2.1)  If you do not already have an account with nvidia, you will need to [create an account here](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl/nccl-download)

Download the file ```NCCL 2.1.15 O/S agnostic and CUDA 9```

#### 2.2) Go to downloads folder, extract, and copy contents to the specified directories
```
cd ~/Downloads
mkdir nccl_2.1
tar -xf nccl_2.1.15-1+cuda9.0_x86_64.txz 
cd nccl_2.1.15-1+cuda9.0_x86_64
cp -R * ~/Downloads/nccl_2.1
sudo mv ~/Downloads/nccl_2.1 /usr/local/
sudo ldconfig
```

## 3.)  Install Python 3.6

#### 3.1)  First check to see if python3.6 is already installed.  If it is, you can skip the next step.
```
python3 --version
```

#### 3.2)  Simply run the commandlines to aquire Python 3.6, pip3, and virtualenvs from the package manager
```
sudo apt-get install python3.6-dev
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
```

#### 3.2)  Check to see if you have virtualenvwrapper setup
If the output to this command is mkvirtualenv: command not found proceed to the next step.  Otherwise skip step 3.3.
```
mkvirtualenv dl4cv
```

#### 3.3)  Setup virtualenvwrapper. To read more about using virtualenvwrappers [check out this link](https://itnext.io/virtualenv-with-virtualenvwrapper-on-ubuntu-18-04-goran-aviani-d7b712d906d5)
Also note that your-username-here must be replaced with your actual username.
```
mkdir ~/.virtualenv
echo '# virtualenvwrapper setup' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV=/home/your-username-here/.local/bin/virtualenv' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'source ~/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 3.4)  Create a virtual envelope to install your tensorflow to, and start working on it.  While working on this virtualenvelopewrapper python packages you install will be installed to the /home/your-username-here/.virtualenvs dir.  This is helpful when it comes to managing dependencies.
```
mkvirtualenv dl4cv
workon dl4cv
```


## 4.)  Build and install Tensorflow r1.12 from source

#### 4.1)  Create a Software directory then change into this directory. 
```
mkdir ~/Software
cd ~/Software
```

#### 4.2)  Clone the tensorflow repo, next change into tensorflow directory, then checkout r1.12, finally configure the tensorflow build
```
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
cd tensorflow
git checkout r1.12
./configure
```

#### 4.3) The configure screen will give you several options.  
Note that the compute capability will depend on your hardware.  verify your gpu and it's compute capability [using this link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

Please specify the location of python. [Default is /usr/bin/python]: /usr/bin/python3.6

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Apache Ignite support? [Y/n]: n

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with XLA JIT support? [Y/n]: n

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with OpenCL SYCL support? [y/N]: n

#### 4.4) The next step in the process to install tensorflow GPU version will be to build tensorflow using bazel. This process takes a fairly long time.
```
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --config=monolithic
```
